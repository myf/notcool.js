Notcool.js
==========

An ugly implementation of browser based terminal.
------------------------------------------------

notcool.js builds a simple and ugly terminal by using canvas in your browser that takes text input, send it back to shell in the server, then return results back to the same canvas viao socket.io.

run:

> node socket.js
